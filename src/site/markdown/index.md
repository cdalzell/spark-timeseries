title: Overview

Spark-Timeseries is a library for analyzing large-scale time series data sets.

It offers:

* A set of abstractions for manipulating time series data, similar to what's provided for smaller
  data sets in
  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/timeseries.html),
  [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/time-series.html), and R's
  [zoo](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html) and
  [xts](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html) packages.
* Models, tests, and functions that enable dealing with time series from a statistical perspective,
  similar to what's provided in [StatsModels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/tsa.html)
  and a variety of Matlab and R packages.
